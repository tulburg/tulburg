### In my lifetime

What I hope would be acheived in my lifetime is the next stage of programming. When we finally can decode all terabytes of data
in DNA and can program/reprogram cells for specific purposes.

Since the invent of silicon programming, without an express analysis, we can easily predict the next programming invention and distruption
would be bio programming. At the moment, we know little about how cells are generated and programmed through the DNA for a single
purpose. In my understanding, we have single purpose cells and multipurpose cells which usually originates from a single purpose cell reading the DNA,
utilising the resources provided and the energy required, to not only interpret the next lines of the coded DNA, but produce such cell
that will be responsible for the task.

While watching a single cell, like an egg, coated with resources and supplied with enough energy to consume these resources, it is 
evident that the application of programming/reprogramming cells is crucial in solving most common humanity problems: aging, 
lost limbs, eyesight, addiction and mental problems. 

And i will so much like to be part of this evolution.


### AI and Robotics

With our advances in AI, we've acheived some impressive functions from our little statistical equations. Although i've never been
satisfied with these achievements. To put it simply, I which to achieve, not just modular, but an algorithm that will be able to generate
its own models given some few parameters by examining the surrounding properties.

> AI that can build a model on a single picture and nothing more (there are more information there beyond the pixels)

The need for an AI to be able to model and remodel its knowledge is crucial to the next distruption of AI. As humans, we never stop
learning, why should an AI?
